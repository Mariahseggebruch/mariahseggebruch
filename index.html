                    <p class="scroll-animated">In the past, I was a top sales representative for a for a fortune 500 company. Due to my success, I was chosen to roll out Sales Force for a satellite office in Orlando. This included best practices for using the app, trouble shooting, leadership and management training. It was in that moment I knew I wanted to change trajectory of my career, I needed to be in tech!</p>

                    <p class="scroll-animated">I'm a sales proficient software engineer. This last year at Atlas, I have dived into a rigorous Full-Stack program. The project based and peer learning curriculum have undoubtedly pushed me and shown me how much is possible when you dedicate yourself. I'm excited to utilize my technical, leadership, and sales experience in a role to contribute meaningfully to a dynamic team, drive innovation, and achieve tangible results that propel the company forward!</p>

                                    <p> In my web design journey, I embarked on two distinct projects showcasing my evolving skills. The first, "Hack Sprint - Breakfast Crepes," revolved around a breakfast theme. I created my first static website using HTML and CSS, focusing on the delectable world of breakfast crepes. This project allowed me to grasp the basics of web design and implement them in a creative and visually appealing manner.</p>

                                    <p> The second project, "Toxic Flora - The Museum of Imagination," involved the creation of a website for a hypothetical toxic plant museum. Employing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I crafted pages that not only displayed information about the museum but also incorporated interactive elements. This project challenged me to enhance my skills beyond static design, providing a dynamic and engaging user experience.</p>

These experiences at Atlas School equipped me with valuable skills in planning, executing, and completing projects in collaborative educational settings.</p>

Exploring the capabilities of Figma provided me with practical insights into designing user interfaces and experiences. The collaborative nature of Figma allowed me to grasp the fundamentals of wireframing, prototyping, and refining designs based on user-centric considerations, giving me a valuable taste of UX/UI design within the context of web development.</p>
                                    <p>This exposure not only expanded my skill set but also emphasized the symbiotic relationship between development and design. Learning Figma at Atlas School was a pivotal experience that laid the foundation for integrating front-end development with a keen awareness of creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.</p>

My classmate and I have experience in the restaurant industry, where we know how important it can be for a patron to see the full menu with ingredients.

Ours was over different varieties of toxic plants where you could see them up close, see how they would be used in spells and at the end you could purchase one for yourself. Featuring javascript, CSS framework, and hosted it on github pages.</p>

                                <p>Capstone project wrapping up my education at Atlas. My team and I simplified the process of finding AND promoting weekend sales. Tired of driving around looking for a good garage sale? Look no further. This single platform allows you to find sales in a list or a map view. When uploading your sale, you are able to add photots and select categories to attract those looking for specific items. Don't want to get on Facebook to use marketplace to find an estate sale? Yard Hopper is all you need. We used Figma for design, React Native for the interface as well as Expo for development. Our backend team used Express API, Firebase, Cloud Firestore.
